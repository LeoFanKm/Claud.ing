      "codeSecurity": {
        "question": "Is my code secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, your code never leaves your local machine. Claude Code runs entirely on your device, and we only store task metadata (titles, descriptions, status) on our servers. Your source code and sensitive data remain private."
      },
      "supportedAgents": {
        "question": "Which AI agents are supported?",
        "answer": "We currently support Claude Code as the primary AI agent. Claude Code can analyze your codebase, break down complex tasks, and provide intelligent suggestions. Support for additional agents is planned for future releases."
      },
      "isFree": {
        "question": "Is it free to use?",
        "answer": "The Kanban board features are free to use. However, AI-powered features like task breakdown and intelligent suggestions require a Claude Code subscription, which you manage through Anthropic."
      },
      "parallelExecution": {
        "question": "How does parallel execution work?",
        "answer": "Claude Code can execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously. When you have tasks without dependencies, our system automatically identifies and runs them in parallel, significantly reducing overall completion time."
      },
      "vscodeSupport": {
        "question": "Does it work with VS Code?",
        "answer": "Yes! Claude Code integrates seamlessly with VS Code through the official extension. You can manage tasks directly from your editor and have Claude Code work on your codebase without leaving your development environment."
      },
      "whatIsMcp": {
        "question": "What is MCP?",
        "answer": "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely connect with external tools and data sources. It allows Claude Code to interact with your development environment, databases, and other services while maintaining security boundaries."
