      "codeSecurity": {
        "question": "Is my code secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, your code never leaves your local machine. Claude Code runs entirely on your device, and we only store task metadata (titles, descriptions, status) on our servers. Your source code and sensitive data remain private."
      },
      "supportedAgents": {
        "question": "Which AI agents are supported?",
        "answer": "We support multiple AI agents including Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Amp, Qwen, Opencode, and Factory Droid. Each agent can analyze your codebase, break down complex tasks, and provide intelligent suggestions."
      },
      "isFree": {
        "question": "Is it free to use?",
        "answer": "The Kanban board features are free to use. However, AI-powered features like task breakdown and intelligent suggestions require a subscription to your chosen AI agent provider."
      },
      "parallelExecution": {
        "question": "How does parallel execution work?",
        "answer": "AI agents can execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously. When you have tasks without dependencies, our system automatically identifies and runs them in parallel, significantly reducing overall completion time."
      },
      "vscodeSupport": {
        "question": "Does it work with VS Code?",
        "answer": "Yes! Many AI agents integrate seamlessly with VS Code. You can manage tasks directly from your editor and have agents work on your codebase without leaving your development environment."
      },
      "whatIsMcp": {
        "question": "What is MCP?",
        "answer": "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely connect with external tools and data sources. It allows AI agents to interact with your development environment, databases, and other services while maintaining security boundaries."
